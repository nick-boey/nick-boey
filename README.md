Hey there, I'm Nick.

I'm a structural engineer, the Structural Division Technical Lead and the Digital Innovation Lead at [Northrop Consulting Engineers](https://www.northrop.com.au).

In my spare time, I'm working on a PhD in Timber Concrete Composite floors and a new open-source functional programming language for building engineers called [Sunset](https://github.com/sunset-lang/).

Hit me up on email at nboey@northrop.com.au if you'd like to chat about anything.
